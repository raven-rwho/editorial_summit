Summary
Dmitry Shishkin and Peter Krauss discussed the strategic importance of journalism niches, emphasizing the need for data-driven approaches to identify and develop them. They highlighted the necessity of a unified data foundation, cross-functional teams, and the use of advanced techniques like embeddings and AI to automate content discovery and personalization for future newsrooms. Key talking points included the importance of data in identifying what people read, structuring data departments for niche development, resolving conflicting data sources, and leveraging data for content exchange and automated experiences.

Details
Niches in Journalism Dmitry Shishkin initiated a discussion on journalism niches, emphasizing their role in enabling original journalism and the need for clarity on what is and isn't being covered. Peter Krauss added that a deeper understanding of existing content and desired content is crucial for niche development, citing the success of a "fame fighting" event that led to significant subscription sales. They highlighted the importance of data in identifying what people read and do not read, and discussed the lack of a fundamental approach to data as a blind spot for future success.
Identifying and Approaching Niches with Data Peter Krauss explained that from a technical data perspective, identifying a niche like travel involves comparing performance with competitors and using algorithmic recommendations to suggest content to editorial teams. Dmitry Shishkin inquired about approaching niche identification from an editorial perspective, suggesting that data should inform what kind of research and conversations are needed to identify a niche, especially when editorial teams express interest in specific areas (00:02:29). Peter Krauss added that even if internal data is lacking, insights can be gained by learning from others who have successfully established niches (00:04:32).
Structuring Data Departments for Niche Development Dmitry Shishkin questioned the optimal setup for a data department within an organization to support niche development, moving beyond traditional monthly or annual reporting to more daily and weekly insights (00:04:32). Peter Krauss advocated for cross-functional teams, highlighting that central data teams often lack the contextual knowledge to evaluate data accuracy (e.g., whether an article should have received more clicks or subscriptions). They emphasized the need for close input from individuals with contextual knowledge and the development of daily-use products for these teams, citing the success of having a "champion" like Meny Zaka, the deputy editor and chief from Bild, who was interested in understanding and utilizing data solutions (00:06:03).
Collaboration and Conflicting Data Sources Dmitry Shishkin raised concerns about potential conflicting messages from different data-centric departments such as editorial analytics, audience engagement, product managers, and the central data department (00:07:20). Peter Krauss explained that Axel Springer addressed this by establishing a common platform for all teams to view each other's products and by forming cross-functional teams. Peter Krauss noted that building products for the editorial department, such as recommendation tools that help identify relevant content, generated significant value and traction (00:08:22).
Data Normalization and Common Media Ontology Peter Krauss emphasized the necessity of a single data foundation, or "common media ontology," across different brands and countries for scaling solutions. Dmitry Shishkin further explored normalizing this ontology across various third-party data streams interacting with the same content, to unleash potential by connecting disparate data points (00:13:51). Peter Krauss explained that this involves defining clear data contracts for datasets, akin to microservice architecture, and automating data ingestion and distillation into the ontology layer via code to ensure a single source of truth (00:15:08).
Challenges in Data Definition and KPI Alignment Peter Krauss noted that page view definitions vary across brands, even with shared analytics tools, making normalization crucial. Dmitry Shishkin pressed on this point, questioning why definitions differ if editorial analytics systems are the same, leading Peter Krauss to clarify that different systems are used by different brands (e.g., Google Analytics vs. Marfield) (00:17:18). Dmitry Shishkin and Peter Krauss agreed that expecting an entire organization to align on a single KPI like page views is unrealistic, especially given the inherent conflicting goals in news media (e.g., reach vs. subscriptions) (00:11:51).
Use Cases for Data and Niche Content Discovery Peter Krauss outlined use cases for data, including having a layer of intelligence for content exchange, recreation, or translation. They discussed identifying content relevant to different genders and user needs, emphasizing the importance of brand safety over clickbait (00:20:14). Peter Krauss also highlighted the relevance of hyper-regional content and using data to automate experiences like newsletters and notifications based on user interest (00:21:15).
The Future of Newsrooms and Automated Content Discovery Peter Krauss described a future newsroom model, exemplified by "Morning Crunch," where AI automates content aggregation from various sources like Reddit, providing editors with curated recommendations for original content (00:22:32). They highlighted the "trend score" KPI that normalizes promotion bias, which is crucial for personalization (00:24:50). Peter Krauss explained that this model significantly reduces the effort in content discovery, creation, and distribution, allowing small teams to produce engaging and profitable niche newsletters (00:25:58).
Content Format Identification and Multimodality Peter Krauss agreed with Dmitry Shishkin's suggestion to automate content format identification within the CMS to provide more prescriptive recommendations to newsrooms. Peter Krauss further proposed thinking about multimodality, where text can be transcreated into videos or other formats based on the distribution channel (00:27:00). They discussed how multimodality could also apply to delivering content based on user needs, such as an "update me" or "educate me" piece (00:28:06).
Embeddings and Internet-Wide Content Similarity Peter Krauss explained that "embeddings" (mathematical representations of content) have revolutionized content similarity calculation, enabling automated identification of similar articles (00:28:06). Peter Krauss noted that this technology allows for analyzing all internet content to find similarities to what a news organization is looking for, making niche content discovery much easier (00:29:08). They stated that this capability, combined with promotion bias-normalized KPIs, is the "secret sauce" for future content strategies (00:30:15).
Solving Personalization Challenges with External Data Addressing the challenge of insufficient content volume for effective personalization in media, Peter Krauss suggested scraping external content (without copying) to understand what performs well for specific brands (00:30:15). Peter Krauss emphasized that this approach, combined with a data foundation across different brands, allows news organizations to leverage knowledge about well-performing content at scale. Dmitry Shishkin summarized key enablers discussed, including vectorization, transcreation, promotion bias normalization, multi-skilled teams, and automated recommendations (00:31:21).
Protoise and Future Newsroom Vision Peter Krauss viewed Protoise, Ringio's content-sharing tool, as the foundation for the future, requiring content to be enriched with intelligence, including data from external sources (00:32:31). Peter Krauss reiterated the need to combine internal and external content data, including embeddings, to identify similarities and distill sorting mechanisms for recommendations (00:33:47). Peter Krauss concluded by stating that the future of newsrooms involves automating discovery for niche editors, with roughly 20% of content being original and 80% being automated from other sources (00:34:34).
