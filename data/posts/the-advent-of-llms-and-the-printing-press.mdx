## Summary
Peter Kraus, Head of Data for the Global Media Unit, presents a comprehensive vision for implementing AI-driven innovation across the media value chain. His presentation outlines how large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing content creation in ways comparable to the invention of the printing press, and details the organization's strategic approach to harnessing this technology through specialized teams and platforms like Protois.

## The Gutenberg Moment for Modern Media

"The advent of LLMs is comparable to the invention of the printing press," Peter Kraus declared at the beginning of his presentation. Drawing a parallel between today's AI revolution and Gutenberg's transformative innovation, Kraus emphasized how both technologies fundamentally change content creation by making the process more efficient and less expensive.

While acknowledging the disruptive nature of this shift, Kraus framed it primarily as "a massive opportunity" for editorial teams. The focus of his presentation was clear: leveraging AI advancements to streamline media creation across the entire value chain.

## The News Media Value Chain

According to Kraus, the news media creation process typically follows four critical steps:

1. Content discovery
2. Content generation
3. Distribution
4. Monetization

The Global Media Unit is developing various tools and systems to enhance each of these stages. Kraus mentioned several existing solutions, including Florian for maximizing programmatic advertising revenue, personalized content curation systems, social media distribution tools, and data-to-content generation services such as travel information and chatbots.

## Protois: The Content Exchange Platform

The centerpiece of Kraus's presentation was Protois, a content exchange platform designed to share and translate content across Rengi's diverse media brands. This system processes approximately 10,000 articles weekly, creating a unified content repository that serves multiple brands.

"We are feeding there every week 10,000 articles into it," Kraus noted when explaining the scale of the operation.

Protois is built on what Kraus calls the "common media ontology" – a standardized data foundation that creates consistent structure across different media brands despite their varying business models. While some brands have subscribers and others don't, and advertising differs by country and brand, certain elements like publication structures remain consistent.

## Organizational Structure for Innovation

To drive these initiatives forward, Kraus outlined four specialized teams:

1. **The Ontology Team**: Responsible for building Protois and the underlying data foundation, ensuring each country has proper data infrastructure.

2. **Agentic Workflows Team**: Focused on increasing efficiency in editorial and back-office processes.

3. **Upskilling and Enablement Team**: Supporting use cases on the Foundry and AIP platforms, while creating playbooks and frameworks for scaling proven solutions.

4. **Media Innovations Team**: Exploring disruptive business models that leverage the organization's existing advantages – user reach, brand safety, ad networks, and sales connections – to rapidly develop new media startups without legacy constraints.

Kraus specifically mentioned the Azzed magazine as an example of a new venture primarily driven by content from Protois, noting that his colleague Stefan Meyer would present more details about this project at the upcoming editorial senate.

## The Future of Intelligent Content

Looking ahead, Kraus described how layers of AI intelligence are being added to the Protois platform. These enhancements will enable:

- Performance prediction for content (estimating potential clicks)
- Relevance assessment for specific audience segments
- Content similarity identification for deduplication and related content suggestions

These capabilities will support new business cases, including:

- Content recommendations for editorial teams
- Semi-automated content verticals (with human oversight)
- Automated newsletters
- Fully automated content verticals
- Multi-channel content distribution

Kraus concluded by mentioning a new similarity search feature in Protois, though he didn't demonstrate it during this presentation.

## Conclusion

The Global Media Unit's approach represents a comprehensive strategy for embracing AI in journalism while maintaining human editorial judgment. By building standardized data foundations and specialized teams, they aim to transform potential disruption into opportunity, creating more efficient workflows and new business models across their media ecosystem.
