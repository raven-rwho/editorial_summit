## The Changing Landscape of Content Creation

As the meeting concluded with a round of applause for Anders, attention turned to an introspective look at Ringe's own content strategy. The transition marked a pivotal moment as the company faces the reality of a rapidly evolving media landscape—one that will fundamentally reshape how content is created, distributed, and consumed in the coming years.

## Three Distinct Content Pillars

Looking toward the future, Ringe's content ecosystem will be built upon three foundational pillars, each representing a different approach to content creation and each requiring strategic consideration.

### AI-Powered Content: The Inevitable Wave

The first pillar, as impressively demonstrated by Benedikt during his earlier presentation, will be AI-powered content. This represents not just a technological advancement but a paradigm shift in how media organizations approach content production. The potential volume and capabilities of AI-generated content are staggering, leaving Ringe with important decisions about how to harness this technology effectively.

"We've heard it impressively from Benedikt, how much there will be, how much is possible, and it's up to us to decide on how we benefit from it or not," noted the presenter, highlighting the agency Ringe maintains in this technological revolution.

### Human-Powered Content: The Traditional Core

Despite being Ringe's bread and butter for over four centuries, human-created content represents perhaps the most challenging strategic question facing the organization. With finite resources and increasing competition from both AI and creator-driven content, determining where to invest human talent and energy becomes increasingly complex.

"I think that one will be the trickiest one, even if it's what we've been doing for 400 years," the speaker reflected. "To decide on where to invest our energy and our resources, I think that's the trickiest question to answer."

### Creator-Powered Content: The Personal Touch

The third pillar, creator-powered content, stands as an interesting counterpoint to AI-generated material. While AI offers scalability and efficiency, creator content delivers complete personalization—"the human as a brand." This content category has already established itself in the media ecosystem and represents an important collaborative opportunity for traditional media organizations like Ringe.

## Finding the Right Balance

The central challenge for Ringe moving forward will be mastering all three content types while establishing the right balance between them. By 2030, the presenter estimated that at least 50% of content distributed by Ringe might be machine-driven, particularly for news-focused brands like Blick or Blitz.

However, this balance will likely vary significantly across Ringe's portfolio. Special interest publications, such as Schweizer Illustriert, will maintain a higher proportion of human-created content. As the presenter noted, "If you go to a federal council to do a home story, probably it will not come from a bot, it might come from a creator, but it probably comes from a human being."

## The Path Forward

This framework is not a finalized strategy but rather a recognition of the evolving reality Ringe faces. Success in the coming years will depend on thoughtfully balancing these three content sources, understanding their respective strengths and limitations, and deploying each where it creates the most value.

As the meeting moved toward a short break, the alternating refrain of "AI-powered, human-powered" hung in the air—a rhythmic reminder of the dual forces that will shape Ringe's future in content creation.
