## The New Gutenberg Moment

"The advent of LLMs is comparable to the invention of the printing press," declares Peter Kraus, Head of Data for the Global Media Unit, as he opens his presentation on AI-powered newsroom innovation. Just as Gutenberg's printing press made content creation cheaper and more accessible by mechanizing the writing process, Large Language Models (LLMs) are poised to transform how media organizations operate today.

While acknowledging the disruptive nature of this technological shift, Kraus emphasizes the tremendous opportunity it presents. "It's a real massive opportunity," he insists, urging media professionals to embrace LLMs to make media creation easier for editorial teams across the organization.

## The Media Value Chain: A Holistic Approach

Kraus outlines his vision of the news media creation value chain, which consists of four primary steps:

1. Content discovery
2. Content generation
3. Distribution
4. Monetization

The Global Media Unit is developing various tools and systems to enhance each stage of this process. Some of these innovations include:

- **Florian**: A tool designed to maximize floor prices for programmatic advertising
- **Personalized curation**: Already implemented across many brands
- **Social media distribution**: Streamlined content delivery to various platforms
- **Data-to-content conversion**: Including travel services, chatbots, and the IWA service that automatically generates content from existing data

However, the centerpiece of Kraus's presentation is **Protois**, an advanced content exchange platform that facilitates sharing and immediate translation of content across Rengi's diverse media brands.

## Organizational Structure: Four Specialized Teams

To drive these innovations forward, the Global Media Unit has established four dedicated teams:

### 1. Ontology Team
This team is building Protois and, more importantly, developing the underlying data foundation that will ensure each country has appropriate data structures in place.

### 2. Agentic Workflows Team
Focused on increasing efficiency not only for editorial processes but also for back-office operations through AI-powered workflows.

### 3. Upskilling and Enablement Team
Dedicated to supporting use cases on foundry and AIP platforms while creating playbooks, frameworks, and tools to scale proven solutions like the travel service.

### 4. Media Innovations Team
Perhaps the most forward-thinking group, this team explores how the organization might disrupt itself by leveraging existing advantages—user reach, brand safety, ad networks, and sales connections—to build new business cases rapidly. Kraus notes that Stefan Meyer has taken a leadership role in this area and will present more details at the upcoming editorial senate.

"The core idea of these three teams is to utilize the data and especially foundry AIP to leverage synergies across the group and build one common data foundation," Kraus explains.

## Protois and the Common Media Ontology: The Foundation for the Future

Diving deeper into Protois, Kraus explains the concept of a "common media ontology"—a standardized data structure applicable across all media brands. While acknowledging the challenges in creating a universal framework (some brands have subscribers while others don't, advertising differs by country and brand), he emphasizes that certain elements, like publications, maintain consistent structures.

This common ontology serves as the foundation for Protois, which already processes approximately 10,000 articles weekly. Kraus presents a schematic showing how content flows from various brand sources into Protois, where multiple layers of intelligence are applied.

In the future, Protois will offer advanced capabilities:

- Predicting content performance (clicks, engagement)
- Assessing content relevance for specific audience segments
- Identifying similarities between articles to aid in deduplication and content recommendation

These capabilities will enable new business applications:
- Content recommendations for editorial teams
- Semi-automated vertical content creation (with human oversight)
- Automated newsletters
- Fully automated vertical content
- Multi-channel content redistribution

Kraus concludes by mentioning a new feature of Protois—similarity search—though he doesn't demonstrate it during this presentation.

As media organizations navigate the transformative impact of artificial intelligence, the Global Media Unit's comprehensive approach offers a roadmap for embracing these technologies while preserving journalistic values and creating new opportunities for growth and innovation.
