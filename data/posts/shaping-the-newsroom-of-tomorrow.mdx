*A gathering of media leaders at Ringier Group explores how to shape newsrooms for success in the digital age*

## The Zurich Summit: Setting the Stage

On a crisp afternoon in Zurich, the Ringier Group convened a significant assembly of its editorial leadership and digital strategists. The gathering brought together editors-in-chief and specialists from product and digital departments across the media conglomerate's international operations, all united by a common purpose: to architect the newsroom of the future.

As participants settled into the studio space, there was a palpable sense of anticipation. This wasn't a typical editorial meeting focused on content topics or macroeconomic trends. Instead, the group assembled to tackle the fundamental question of how to reshape their newsrooms to ensure future success, audience engagement, and profitability in an ever-evolving media landscape.

## Opening Remarks: A Framework for Transformation

Ladina, one of the event's hosts, opened the session with a warm welcome to attendees who had traveled from various locations to the Zurich headquarters. She immediately established the meeting's focus:

"We are not going to talk a lot about editorial in terms of text, in terms of topics or macroeconomic developments," she explained. "We're going to talk about how we have to shape our newsrooms in order to be successful in future, in order to reach our audiences in future, and of course, as well, in order to be profitable in future."

She acknowledged that the presentations would feature numerous frameworks—conceptual structures designed to make complex ideas more digestible. "Personally, I like frameworks because it makes out of a complex world something quite understandable and something we can talk about, a common language," she noted, expressing hope that participants would find value in these analytical approaches.

## The Agenda: A Packed Program

With a packed three-hour agenda ahead, Ladina emphasized the importance of maintaining pace while ensuring the session delivered meaningful insights that participants could discuss with colleagues afterward.

Michael then took over for housekeeping announcements, establishing the protocol for participation. He requested that speakers use microphones and identify themselves and their organization before speaking—a consideration for digital audience members following remotely.

## Post-Meeting Arrangements

The meeting's conclusion would lead to different paths for attendees. Editorial board members were scheduled to reconvene at 5:30 PM on the fifth floor, while others were invited to an apéro at the same time, offering an opportunity to network and discuss the day's insights over refreshments.

Michael also announced dinner arrangements at the Aurora restaurant near Bahnhofstrasse at 6:30 PM, with Peter—identified as "the one in the purple sweater"—designated as guide for those unfamiliar with the location.

## The AI Perspective

As the meeting prepared to delve into its substantive discussions, Michael introduced Mark, described as Ringier's "biggest AI ambassador," to set the tone for the day's deliberations. This introduction signaled the importance of artificial intelligence in the group's vision for the future of journalism and publishing.

The stage was now set for a deep exploration of how traditional newsroom structures might transform to embrace new technologies, changing audience behaviors, and evolving business models—a conversation that would potentially reshape the future of Ringier's media operations across its global footprint.
