The quiet hum of recording equipment filled the room as the technician began the demonstration. "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7," they counted methodically in German, establishing audio levels and ensuring the system was capturing sound properly.

"I'm making a quick test recording," the technician explained, their voice clear and professional. The purpose was straightforward - to demonstrate the recording process before handing over control. "I'll give you the stick afterward, and then you'll see how it works," they continued, referring to what was likely a USB drive or similar storage device that would contain the recorded audio.

The technician added a personal note: "This is a small test for Peter." This suggested the demonstration was being conducted specifically to help Peter understand the recording system or process.

Concluding the brief test with satisfaction, the technician simply stated, "And that is good," confirming that the equipment was functioning as expected and ready for use.

The entire interaction, though brief, effectively demonstrated both the recording capability and the handoff procedure that would follow, ensuring a smooth transition of technology between participants.
