## Executive Summary

Recent analysis reveals that logged-in users generate ten times more lifetime value than anonymous visitors, presenting a critical strategic imperative for media companies facing declining traffic from traditional sources. This comprehensive study, presented by Patrick at a recent leadership meeting, demonstrates how user loyalty and authentication directly correlate with commercial value across both advertising and subscription revenue streams.

## The Strategic Imperative: Understanding User Value in a Changing Landscape

Michael opened the second half of the meeting with a sobering assessment of the digital media landscape. "Strategically, we have seen that there will be some decline in traffic from some sources," he explained. "These new platforms won't send us back the traffic over these LLMs that we might think, which means the number of users on our platforms will potentially decrease."

This reality underscores the urgent need to maximize the value of each user. Michael acknowledged a historical misstep: "Unfortunately, we have done the mistake in the past not to start with a hard registering wall, what all the platforms have done in order to be able to track and to monetize the user to the fullest."

Patrick, who had been working extensively on this question, took the stage to present compelling data on user value and the critical importance of authentication.

## Breaking Down Silos: Reconciling Advertising and Subscription Models

Patrick began by addressing a fundamental misconception in digital media: "We come from a silo world. We treat our users so far as separate entities on the one side from the digital ad revenue side and on the other side from the digital user market."

This siloed thinking has created a perceived conflict between advertising and subscription goals. "The advertiser guy is saying give us reach so we can sell as much advertising as possible, and the user market guy is saying no, we need exclusivity, please give us articles that we can put behind the paywall," Patrick explained.

The key question: "Is there really such a thing as a target conflict, or is it finally one entity, one of the same user that we are talking about?"

## The Customer Lifetime Value Revelation

To answer this question, Patrick's team developed a comprehensive customer lifetime value (CLV) calculation. "Customer lifetime value refers to the total value a company generates from a customer over the entire duration of their relationship," he explained.

Using the example of Nespresso, Patrick illustrated the concept: A customer spending 300 Swiss francs annually on coffee capsules for five years generates a total revenue of 1,500 Swiss francs—their customer lifetime value.

For digital media, the calculation is more complex but follows the same principle. The team calculated the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) from both subscription and advertising revenue, multiplied by the user's lifetime with the brand, to determine the total CLV.

## The Data Speaks: Analyzing User Value Across Two Dimensions

The team analyzed Blick Digital's German-speaking audience from January 2024 to June 2025, categorizing users across two dimensions:

1. **Funnel Depth**: Five categories from anonymous users to yearly subscribers
2. **Loyalty**: Five categories from one-time readers to brand lovers

This created a matrix of 25 user segments for analysis.

## The Stunning Results: Authenticated Users Worth 10x More

The findings were striking. "The deeper a user is in the funnel, the higher the lifetime value," Patrick revealed. Most significantly, "The CLV of a logged-in user is 10 times bigger than a user without login."

The data also debunked the perceived conflict between advertising and subscription models: "A subscriber also generates high advertising revenues," Patrick noted, pointing to the substantial ad revenue generated by subscribers due to their frequent visits and engagement.

Similarly, on the loyalty dimension: "The more loyal a user is, the higher their lifetime value," with brand lovers generating 10 times more value than casual readers.

## The Heat Map: Where Value Concentrates

Patrick presented a heat map visualizing all 25 user segments, showing a clear pattern: "The more you are on the right side and at the bottom, the higher your customer lifetime value."

The contrast was stark: "The yearly subscription brand lover brings us 1,500 Swiss francs, compared to 2 francs coming from a one-time reader that has given no consent."

Yet the current user distribution is heavily skewed toward the lower-value segments: "900,000 of our customers are in the bucket of consent only, and only 100,000 locked-in users, far less with subscriptions."

## Understanding the Login Value Mechanism

Patrick emphasized that the login itself isn't magical—it's what it enables that creates value: "The user value that we get is through engagement. A login makes the user come more often. It creates more page views and more ad impressions that we can sell."

Additionally, "If we have a direct relationship with the user, we can have a longer lifetime because we have direct contact, we have an email address, we can send newsletters, we can ask them to subscribe."

## Strategic Implementation at Ringier Switzerland

Ringier Switzerland is already putting these insights into action. Patrick showcased features like "Dark Mode" and "Follow Your Team" that provide value to users while requiring authentication. "We need the login, but we also need the features and the products that come with it to make users come back more often."

Looking ahead to the AI-dominated future, Patrick warned: "With AI mode coming, which users are most in danger? It's the users with low loyalty and without login or subscription. So we have high incentive to go on this journey."

## A Call to Action and Historical Perspective

Following Patrick's presentation, Marc shared a passionate perspective on the industry's hesitation to embrace authentication: "This is the battle of my media lifetime, and it's the single most frustrating topic I touched in the last 10 or so years."

Marc recounted efforts to create a unified Swiss media login seven years earlier: "We had 100,000 pages of PowerPoints. We had 50,000 roundtables. We lost seven years, and we're basically nowhere."

He contrasted media with other digital services: "If you take your iPhone, you show me services where you're not locked in except media services. You're locked in in every service you receive."

Marc cited DPG, a leading European publishing group, which has reached 49% logged-in users by requiring authentication for certain services. In contrast, Ringier's Blick stands at approximately 10%.

His conclusion was emphatic: "Work on your logins, work on your logins, work on your logins. We should never again lose seven years for something that is a no-brainer."

## Moving Forward Together

The meeting concluded with an invitation for all teams to participate in this strategic initiative. "The global media unit has several initiatives facing this topic," the moderator noted. "Each company and each brand that you are responsible for, there's one dedicated person that is working in a group for increasing the amount of logged-in users."

The message was clear: make authentication a priority in newsrooms, engage with general managers and product leaders, and actively contribute to this critical transformation that could reshape the economics of digital media.
