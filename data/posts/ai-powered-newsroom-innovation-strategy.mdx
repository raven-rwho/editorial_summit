## Executive Summary
In a groundbreaking presentation, Peter Kraus, Head of Data for the Global Media Unit, outlined how artificial intelligence is transforming media production across their organization. Comparing the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the revolutionary impact of Gutenberg's printing press, Kraus detailed a comprehensive strategy that spans content discovery, generation, distribution, and monetization. Central to this transformation is "Protois," an innovative content exchange platform enabling seamless sharing and translation of articles across multiple media brands.

## The Gutenberg Moment: AI as a Disruptive Force

Peter Kraus opened his presentation with a powerful historical parallel: "The advent of LLM is comparable to the invention of the printing press." Just as Gutenberg's innovation made content creation cheaper and more accessible by mechanizing text production, today's AI technologies are fundamentally changing how media is created and distributed.

"For us, this is quite disruptive. It is a big, big change, but on the other hand, it is a massive opportunity," Kraus emphasized. Rather than viewing AI as a threat, the Global Media Unit sees it as a tool to make media creation easier and more efficient for editorial teams across their network.

## The News Media Value Chain

Kraus outlined a four-step value chain that defines news media creation:

1. **Content Discovery** - Finding and identifying newsworthy topics
2. **Content Generation** - Creating the actual articles and media
3. **Distribution** - Delivering content to various platforms and audiences
4. **Monetization** - Generating revenue from the content

The organization is developing specialized tools for each stage of this process. For monetization, they've created "Florian," a tool designed to maximize floor prices for programmatic advertising. Their distribution strategy includes personalized curation across brands and optimized social media distribution.

A particularly innovative approach is what they call "data to content" - automatically generating content from structured data sources. This includes travel services, chatbots, and the IWA service, representing a fundamental shift in how some content is produced.

## Organizational Structure for Innovation

To drive these technological advancements, the Global Media Unit has established four specialized teams:

### The Ontology Team
This team builds and maintains Protois while establishing the crucial data foundation that underpins all their AI initiatives. They ensure each country has appropriate data infrastructure in place.

### The Agentic Workflows Team
Focused on increasing efficiency for both editorial and back-office processes, this team explores how AI can streamline workflows throughout the organization.

### The Upskilling and Enablement Team
This group supports use cases on their Foundry and AIP platforms, while creating playbooks, frameworks, and tools for scaling successful solutions like their travel service.

### The Media Innovations Team
Perhaps most forward-thinking is the team asking: "How could we disrupt ourselves?" They leverage existing advantages—user reach, brand safety, ad networks, and sales relationships—to imagine new business models as if building a media startup today without legacy constraints.

Kraus expressed enthusiasm about Stefan Meyer's new role leading these efforts, noting that Meyer would be presenting to the editorial senate the following day.

## Protois: A Common Media Ontology

The centerpiece of Kraus's presentation was Protois, their content exchange platform built on a "common media ontology"—a standardized data structure for all media brands.

"This is for us the data foundation that we have to build, which has the same structure for all media brands," Kraus explained. Creating this unified structure presents challenges, as different brands have different features—some have subscribers while others don't, and advertising varies by country and brand.

Despite these differences, core elements like publications maintain the same structure across brands, forming the foundation for Protois. The system already processes 10,000 articles weekly, drawing content from all their brands into a central repository.

## The Intelligence Layers

What makes Protois particularly powerful are the "layers of intelligence" being built on top of the content repository. These AI capabilities enable:

- Performance prediction (estimating how many clicks an article will generate)
- Audience relevance assessment (determining content relevance for specific demographics)
- Content similarity identification (helping with deduplication and content recommendations)

These capabilities support numerous applications, including:
- Content sharing recommendations for editorial teams
- Semi-automated content verticals (with human oversight)
- Automated newsletters
- Fully automated content verticals
- Multi-channel content redistribution

Kraus concluded by mentioning a new Protois feature—similarity search—though the demonstration was deferred.

## Looking Forward

The Global Media Unit's comprehensive approach to AI integration demonstrates how traditional media organizations can embrace technological disruption. By building a common data foundation, developing specialized teams, and creating tools that enhance rather than replace human creativity, they're positioning themselves at the forefront of media innovation.

As Kraus's Gutenberg analogy suggests, we may be witnessing a historic transformation in how news and information are created and distributed—one that will reshape the media landscape for decades to come.
