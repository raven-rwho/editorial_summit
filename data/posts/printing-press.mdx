## Executive Summary

The Global Media Unit is pioneering a comprehensive approach to AI-powered newsroom innovation, creating tools and organizational structures that transform how media content is discovered, generated, distributed, and monetized. Led by Peter Kraus, Head of Data, the initiative compares the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the revolutionary impact of the Gutenberg printing press, viewing technological disruption as an unprecedented opportunity for media organizations.

## The New Media Value Chain

Peter Kraus, Head of Data for the Global Media Unit, opened his presentation with a powerful historical comparison: "The advent of LLMs is comparable to the invention of the printing press." Just as Gutenberg's innovation made content creation cheaper and more accessible by mechanizing text production, today's AI technologies represent both a significant disruption and a tremendous opportunity for media organizations.

"This is a big, big change, but on the other hand, it is a massive opportunity," Kraus emphasized. "Let's use the advent of LLM for our purposes to help all editorial teams make media creation easier."

Kraus outlined his vision of the modern news media value chain, consisting of four primary stages: content discovery, content generation, distribution, and monetization. The Global Media Unit is developing specialized tools for each of these stages, many already in operation across the organization.

### Current Technology Ecosystem

The organization has implemented several AI-powered systems, including:

- **Florian**: A tool designed to maximize floor prices for programmatic advertising
- **Personalized Curation**: Operating across multiple brands to deliver tailored content
- **Social Media Distribution**: Automated systems for content sharing
- **Data to Content**: Systems like the travel service, chatbots, and the IWA service that automatically generate content from data

However, the centerpiece of Kraus's presentation was **Protois**, a sophisticated content exchange platform that enables sharing and automatic translation of content across different media brands within the Rengi group.

## Organizational Structure for Innovation

To drive these technological initiatives forward, the Global Media Unit has established four specialized teams:

### 1. The Ontology Team
This team builds and maintains Protois while developing the underlying data foundation. They ensure each country has appropriate data infrastructure in place to support content exchange and analysis.

### 2. The Agentic Workflows Team
Focused on efficiency improvements, this team examines how to streamline processes not only for editorial work but also for back-office functions through AI implementation.

### 3. The Upskilling and Enablement Team
This group maximizes return on investment from the company's Foundry platform by supporting use cases, particularly those involving Foundry and AIP (AI Platform). They also create playbooks and frameworks for scaling successful solutions like the travel service.

### 4. The Media Innovations Team
Perhaps the most forward-thinking group, this team explores disruptive self-innovation by asking: "How could we disrupt ourselves if we use all the advantages that we have?" They leverage existing assets—user reach, brand safety, ad networks, and sales house connections—to rapidly build new business models on the company's technical foundation.

Kraus mentioned the Azzed magazine as an example of this approach, a new publication primarily driven by content from Protois. He noted that his colleague Stefan Meyer would be presenting more details about this initiative at the upcoming editorial senate.

## Protois and the Common Media Ontology

The presentation delved deeper into Protois and the concept of a common media ontology—a unified data structure for all media brands. Kraus acknowledged the inherent challenges in creating such a system, given the differences between brands (some have subscribers while others don't) and variations in advertising across countries and publications.

Nevertheless, certain elements like publication structure remain consistent across all brands, forming the core of the Protois project. The system currently processes approximately 10,000 articles weekly.

Kraus outlined the architecture of this system: content from various brand sources flows into Protois, where multiple layers of AI-powered intelligence analyze and enhance it. The system also provides translation capabilities.

### Future Capabilities

The roadmap for Protois includes several advanced features:

- **Performance prediction**: Forecasting metrics like click-through rates for content
- **Audience relevance assessment**: Determining content relevance for specific demographic groups
- **Content similarity identification**: Detecting relationships between articles to assist with deduplication and content recommendations

These capabilities will enable new business applications, including:
- Content sharing recommendations for editorial teams
- Semi-automated content verticals (with human oversight)
- Automated newsletters
- Fully automated content verticals
- Multi-channel content redistribution

Kraus concluded his presentation by mentioning a new similarity search feature in Protois, though the demonstration of this feature was deferred.

This comprehensive approach to AI integration across the media value chain represents a forward-thinking strategy for navigating the digital transformation of journalism. By embracing AI as an opportunity rather than a threat, the Global Media Unit is positioning itself at the forefront of media innovation while creating tools that enhance rather than replace human editorial judgment.
