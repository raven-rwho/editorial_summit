## Summary
At a recent strategic meeting, Ringier executives and industry leaders gathered to discuss their approach to the AI revolution in media. The session highlighted how this disruption represents not just another technological change but a fundamental business threat requiring a comprehensive transformation strategy.

## The Challenge: More Than Just Another Disruption

CEO Mark Walder opened the meeting with a stark assessment of the current media landscape. Following his introduction, Michael emphasized the gravity of the situation facing traditional media companies.

"This is not just another disruption that the media is seeing, it's a business threat," Michael stated. "There's a tectonic shift in the media ecosystem, and we have to define our job to be done for the future."

He stressed that in the longer term, Ringier would need to find a new value proposition within the evolving media ecosystem. The success factors for this transformation had already been identified, including technology harmonization and developing stronger user relationships that match the experience offered by emerging platforms.

## Learning from Both Worlds: Legacy Media and AI-Native Approaches

Ladina outlined the day's agenda, which was designed to tackle the key success factors through a combination of external perspectives and internal strategies. The meeting featured two guest speakers representing contrasting approaches to the AI challenge:

1. Benedict Honnet, Managing Director of Upday – representing a "greenfield approach" with an almost exclusively AI-based news aggregator
2. Anders Eriksson, CEO of News Media at Bonnier – offering insights from another legacy media company undergoing transformation

"One is kind of a greenfield approach to AI, something kind of completely new and very, very AI-based, almost exclusively AI-based. And the other is not unlike Ringier, a legacy media company who needs to transform itself," Ladina explained.

## Ringier's Three-Pronged Strategy

The meeting then shifted to Ringier's internal approach, focusing on three key dimensions:

### 1. AI-Driven Content Strategy
Peter Kraus, Head of Data, presented frameworks for defining different types of content and how AI could be integrated into each. This segment aimed to establish clear guidelines for when and how to deploy AI across Ringier's content ecosystem.

### 2. User Value Quantification
Patrick Raudemacher shared findings from months of research into user value metrics, particularly examining whether "locked-in" users genuinely provide more value than non-committed users.

"Is it really true that a locked-in user has more value than a user who's not locked in? We think it's a yes. Now we have an answer," Ladina revealed, offering a preview of the findings.

### 3. Human-Powered Content Differentiation
Perhaps the most challenging aspect of the strategy involved defining the future of human-created content. Dima Mityushishkin, along with Head of HR Marike, addressed how Ringier could differentiate its human-generated content from machine output and foster a culture that empowers staff through this transition.

"How can we make a difference to all the machines out there?" Ladina posed, framing the central question of this segment.

## Live AI Demonstration

To demonstrate that "the future is already here," Peter introduced an experimental prototype that would automatically process the audio from all presentations and publish it to a password-protected website accessible to all attendees.

"We want to showcase that the future is here already, and this is why we built a small prototype that actually will take the audio streams from all the presentations and will publish this completely automatically after the session," Peter explained.

This live experiment was designed to conclude the session, with results shared at the end – creating what Ladina described as a "Wetten Das" TV show moment where everyone would discover if the technology challenge succeeded.

## First Keynote: The AI-Native Approach

The meeting then welcomed its first keynote speaker, Hans Ribonet (introduced as Andre), CEO of Upday. Upday represented a fascinating case study – originally developed as a news aggregator for Samsung apps, it had transformed into a purely AI-driven newsroom under Axel Springer's investment.

Ribonet, with his background spanning traditional media outlets and consulting at BCG before joining Axel Springer, offered valuable perspective on how a media organization might look if built from scratch in the AI era – addressing the recurring question of whether traditional newsrooms would be designed the same way if created today.

## Conclusion

As the meeting progressed, it became clear that Ringier's leadership views AI not merely as a tool to incorporate but as a force requiring fundamental rethinking of their business model. Their approach balances learning from both AI-native startups and fellow legacy media companies while developing a three-dimensional strategy encompassing AI integration, user value optimization, and human content differentiation.

The experimental live AI demonstration underscored the company's commitment to not just discussing technological transformation but actively experiencing it – a fitting embodiment of their forward-looking strategy in navigating media's AI revolution.
