## The Challenge and Solution

At a recent editorial summit, what began as a casual suggestion evolved into a remarkable demonstration of AI's capabilities in journalism. About six weeks before the event, Ladina approached one of the development team members with an intriguing question: Could they build something that showcases the potential of AI in content creation?

"It doesn't matter how old I become, I always think things are much easier than they are in the end," the developer admitted during the presentation. Despite the inherent challenges, they accepted the task with confidence, believing they could create something meaningful to demonstrate these emerging capabilities.

The result was an elegantly simple website with profound functionality. The interface allows users to upload audio files and, with a single click on "publish article," sets in motion a sophisticated chain of AI processes:

1. The system automatically transcribes the audio
2. It generates a well-structured text from the transcript
3. It creates an appropriate title
4. It searches for relevant images
5. Finally, it publishes the complete article

## From Concept to Reality

The most impressive aspect of this demonstration wasn't just the technology itself, but the speed of development. "I was able to build this pretty much in the last two weeks," the developer explained, "which wouldn't have been possible without the help of Dieter, and in this case, also Claude Code."

While the developer was modest about the achievement, emphasizing that this was not yet production-ready, the results were nonetheless impressive. The demonstration featured articles generated from five talks delivered at the summit, including one by Mark titled "Be the Translator."

## The Results in Action

To illustrate the quality of the AI-generated content, the presenter shared examples from the articles. One excerpt about Mark's presentation read: "The second level concerns data efficiency, the behind-the-scenes infrastructure that powers AI capabilities. Mark highlighted Ringier's initiative of Palantir, explaining that the AIP, artificial intelligence platform collaboration, would help structure data for radically more efficient use across the organization."

This level of coherence and accuracy was achieved with minimal prompting—"the prompt has two lines or something," the developer noted, adding with a touch of humor, "I used to be a software engineer, now I'm a prompt engineer who generates code."

## Future Implications

The demonstration represents a significant step forward in exploring how AI can augment journalistic workflows. While the developer was careful to clarify that the system was "far away from production," the potential was clear to everyone in attendance.

The response was enthusiastic, with one attendee commenting, "Don't be too modest, that's fantastic." The team promised to share access to the demonstration website, allowing attendees to explore the technology with their teams.

By the end of the summit, the developer hoped to have all the talks from the event processed through the system, providing a comprehensive showcase of what's possible with today's AI technology in journalism.

## Conclusion

This demonstration represents the beginning of a new chapter in content creation—one where AI assists journalists by handling time-consuming tasks like transcription and initial drafting, potentially freeing human journalists to focus on deeper analysis, investigation, and storytelling. While still in its early stages, the technology offers a compelling glimpse into how newsrooms might operate in the very near future.
