## A Vision for the Future of News Media

In an insightful presentation at a recent Ringier media gathering, Peter Kraus, Head of Data and one of the creators of AppDei, shared groundbreaking developments in how artificial intelligence is reshaping the media landscape at Ringier. The session revealed how the company is leveraging AI to enhance content creation, discovery, and distribution across its diverse portfolio of brands.

## The Gutenberg Moment for Digital Media

"The advent of LLMs is comparable to the invention of the printing press," Kraus quoted from a former Axel Springer colleague. This powerful comparison set the tone for his presentation, highlighting how AI is fundamentally changing the economics of content creation.

Just as the printing press made content production more affordable and accessible, today's AI technologies are dramatically reducing the cost of creating quality content. While this disruption challenges traditional media business models, Kraus emphasized that it also presents remarkable opportunities for innovation.

To illustrate his point, Kraus demonstrated how simple text prompts could generate sophisticated visual content in seconds—work that previously would have required days of effort from professional designers.

## Ringier's AI-Powered Value Chain

Ringier has been systematically implementing AI solutions across the entire media value chain. These implementations include:

### Content Discovery
The cornerstone of Ringier's AI strategy starts with intelligent content discovery systems that help identify valuable information and trends.

### Content Generation
Multiple AI-powered systems are enhancing content creation:
- Automated translation services that maintain quality across languages
- Data-to-content systems that transform raw information into readable articles
- The travel service, which automatically generates content compelling enough to attract sponsors

### Content Distribution
AI is reshaping how content reaches audiences through:
- Personalized curation across different products and markets
- Intelligent content delivery systems via the CDE (Content Delivery Engine)

### Monetization
On the business side, AI systems like "Florian" optimize floor prices for programmatic advertising, while personalized newsletters create new revenue opportunities.

## Building the Organization for AI Integration

To support this transformation, Ringier has established four specialized teams:

1. **Ontology Team**: Developing common data structures at the source level, with projects like ProToys and Florian that can be utilized across all brands.

2. **Agentic Team**: Exploring how to increase efficiency through AI agents, primarily driven by RMS.

3. **Upskilling and Enablement**: A dedicated support team helping scale AI use cases across markets, with the goal of making implementation significantly faster and easier. "If you want to have a chatbot on one of your brands, this will take a day," Kraus explained, outlining their vision for early next year.

4. **Media Innovation**: A forward-thinking group focused on disruption from within. "If we would spin up a new media brand, leveraging all the capacity that the Ringier Group has at the moment... how would we use this?" Kraus posed. This team, supported by Stefan Meyer, is exploring how to utilize AI capabilities to create entirely new business models.

## ProToys: The Intelligent Content Repository

The presentation's highlight was the demonstration of ProToys, Ringier's shared content repository built on Palantir Foundry. This system processes approximately 10,000 articles weekly from across Ringier's brands.

ProToys features a digital twin concept called "ontology" that abstracts data in easily digestible ways. The system is continuously evolving with new layers of intelligence:

- The ability to search for similar articles
- Identification of relevant content
- Performance prediction for articles
- An AI agent that can respond to complex content requests

During the live demonstration, Kraus showcased a new feature launching that same day: an agentic search capability. This allows users to make natural language requests like "Please provide me content that is relevant for a longevity vertical for a media publication," and receive intelligent results based on content understanding rather than just keyword matching.

The technology uses embeddings to translate content into numerical representations that can be compared for similarity—going far beyond traditional keyword searches.

## The Future Vision

Alexander Theobald, who spoke after Kraus, emphasized that this is just the beginning. "We are very convinced that this is only the beginning of ProToys 1.0," he said. The next evolution will include a system where journalists receive daily content recommendations with publishing time suggestions, traffic predictions, and probability metrics.

The ultimate vision includes automated, personalized content distribution. "We believe that [personalization] is the differentiation factor in the future," Theobald concluded.

To further develop these tools, Stefan Meyer will be conducting working sessions with editorial teams to gather feedback and ensure the technology truly serves journalists' needs.

As the presentation concluded and attendees broke for coffee, there was a palpable sense that Ringier is not just adapting to the AI revolution—it's actively shaping how AI will transform media for years to come.
