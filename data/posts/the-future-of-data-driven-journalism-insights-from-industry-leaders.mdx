In a compelling discussion between media experts Dmitry Shishkin and Peter Krauss, key insights emerged about the transformation of modern newsrooms through data-driven approaches and niche development. This conversation revealed how leading news organizations are leveraging technology and data to create more targeted, efficient, and profitable content strategies.

## Key Themes
