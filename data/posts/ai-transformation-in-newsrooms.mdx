## The Challenge of Unique Value in Modern Media

At a recent leadership gathering, media executives explored a critical question facing the industry: What makes content valuable enough that audiences will log in or pay for subscriptions in an increasingly AI-driven world?

The discussion, led by Dima, former head of Ringier Media International (RMI) and now a strategic consultant, alongside Marike, head of HR, focused on how media organizations can empower their staff while leveraging new technologies to create truly distinctive content.

"We need to stop calling a newsroom a newsroom, because it's not longer a room anymore," Dima suggested, highlighting how decentralized the news creation process has become. "Maybe we need to start talking about news halls or something like that."

The fundamental challenge, he explained, is defining a unique proposition. Unlike Netflix, Spotify, or Strava, where consumers rarely question the value, many newsrooms struggle to articulate what makes their offering special.

## Four Pillars of Transformation

Dima outlined four key areas that emerged from his extensive research and interviews with media experts globally:

### 1. Owning Niches

Rather than making broad claims like "we are great at politics," successful media organizations clearly define specific areas of expertise. "Twelve sections need to be unpacked into 60 subsections because every section probably will have five topics that you really care about," Dima explained. This specificity helps both staff and AI language models understand what the organization truly specializes in, rather than appearing to be experts on thousands of topics.

### 2. Audience-Centered Approach

This goes beyond allowing comments or basic participation. It means "commissioning stories and executing stories with people guiding you and with audience playing a really important role," Dima noted. The audience becomes an integral part of the content creation process.

### 3. Strategic Automation

By automating routine content production, organizations can free up resources for high-value journalism. Understanding the breakdown of different article types is essential for determining what can be automated versus what requires human expertise.

### 4. Staff Flexibility and Adaptation

"The most important thing when it comes to skills right now isn't technical competence—it's flexibility," Dima emphasized. Media organizations need staff who understand that job descriptions, titles, and reporting lines may change as the industry evolves.

## Organizational Models for Future Media

Dima presented three potential models for media organizations:

1. **Central Team with Niche Satellites**: Maintaining a core team surrounded by specialized niche content areas
2. **Utility-First Model**: Each niche creates not just content but services that users can only get from that source
3. **Trusted Curator Model**: Curating the best content from across the internet rather than trying to be experts on everything

"We need to treat journalism as a service," Dima insisted. "We need to become so useful to people that they will never question a situation where they cannot live without us."

## The Human Element: Cultural Transformation

Marike shifted the focus to the human side of transformation, introducing Ringier's AI Readiness Framework built around three pillars:

### 1. AI as a Personal Assistant

Encouraging all employees to use AI tools in their daily workflow for tasks like summarization and translation.

### 2. Process Workflow Optimization

Examining each step in content creation to determine where journalistic value is essential and where automation makes sense, with champions at the team level driving this analysis.

### 3. AI for New Business Models

Exploring completely new opportunities and services enabled by AI technology.

"AI is not just a new tool. AI is a new way of working," Marike emphasized. "I'm going to say it again because I think it's a really important message."

## Overcoming Resistance to Change

Addressing the cultural resistance to AI adoption, Marike highlighted the distinction between "onstage" and "offstage" organizational behaviors:

"Onstage means the roadmaps that we have, or it means the leadership speeches and the emails," she explained. "Then there is the offstage part—the informal, invisible beliefs, the water cooler conversations."

The key for leaders is identifying what's happening in these offstage conversations. "If the gap is too big, what can you do to make sure that you are more aware and you really understand the concerns that your employees have?"

Marike offered a practical framework for change management:

1. **Head**: Ensuring intellectual understanding of the changes and their impact
2. **Heart**: Building genuine belief through leadership example and storytelling
3. **Hands**: Providing the tools and dedicated time for experimentation

"You cannot change your team unless you change yourself," Marike concluded. "Leadership is also about vulnerability. It's totally okay in this day and age to say, 'I have no clue. I don't know how to do this. Can you help me?'"

## Practical Implementation

When asked how he would transform a publication like Blick, Dima suggested starting with a single niche: "I would select one topic, do an 80-20 division with 80% automated content and 20% original content, get creators involved, and put audience interest at the center."

This approach allows organizations to experiment with transformation in a focused area before expanding to other sections.

The discussion concluded with a real-world example from Dominic, who described his organization's approach to AI integration. They brought in a specialist to conduct workshops with "super users" who developed specific use cases and created a library of specialized AI prompts (GEMs) that could be shared across the organization.

"People are thrilled by finding help in their daily work," Dominic reported. "Suddenly work is more efficient, more fun. Now everybody's running into these courses."

As media organizations navigate this transformation, the message was clear: success requires both technological innovation and human adaptation, with leaders who can demonstrate vulnerability while guiding their teams toward an AI-enhanced—but still fundamentally human—future of journalism.
