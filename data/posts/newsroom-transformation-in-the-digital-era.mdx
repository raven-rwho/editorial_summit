## Bonnier News: A Digital Transformation Success Story

Anders Eriksson, CEO of Bonnier News, shared his company's remarkable journey of transformation over the past decade. As the largest news media company in the Nordics with approximately one billion euros in annual turnover, Bonnier has undergone a significant evolution from a print-dominated business to a digital-first media organization.

"Ten years ago, print was over 90 percent of our revenue, and digital was basically advertising only with no profitability," Eriksson explained. "Today, 60 percent of our revenues are digital, and most of that comes from subscriptions."

This transformation has been accompanied by impressive financial results. Bonnier has more than doubled in size over the past decade, with EBITDA reaching around 11 percent. The company now reaches 2.6 million subscribers across 14 countries, though Sweden remains its largest market by far.

### The Strategic Flywheel

Eriksson described Bonnier's strategy as a flywheel with freedom of speech at its center:

1. Investing in quality journalism
2. Scaling an integrated ecosystem
3. Increasing the value of product offerings
4. Monetizing that increased value
5. Growing profit to reinvest in journalism

"This wheel is actually spinning quite fast now," Eriksson noted. "The area where I would like it to spin faster is probably some of the product development side that we are now trying to accelerate."

### From Fragmented to Integrated

A critical aspect of Bonnier's transformation was restructuring the organization. The company moved from a highly decentralized structure with separate CEOs, CFOs, and CTOs for each title—which worked well in the print era—to a more integrated, scalable operation.

"In digital, a fragmented structure is highly inefficient," Eriksson emphasized. "We've changed the organization completely in 10 years from a very decentralized organization into an integrated, scalable one company."

While newsrooms and editorial brands maintain their independence, everything else is now integrated to leverage economies of scale. This structural change required significant cultural transformation, guided by the company's core values: engagement, integrity, transparency, and business drive.

### The Subscription-Focused Business Model

Perhaps the most significant change in Bonnier's strategy was pivoting from an advertising-dependent model to one centered on subscriptions. Initially focusing on individual subscriptions, they've evolved to target households and companies with bundled offerings.

Their consumer bundle, called "Plus Alt" ("Plus Everything"), now reaches nearly one million Swedish households—an impressive penetration in a country with 4.5 million total households. More recently, they've launched "Plus Pro" for the business market, featuring general news plus customized content and AI-enhanced features.

"When we move money and users from print to digital, our profit is increasing," Eriksson explained. "We have 25 percent contribution margin in the print side, but 60 percent in the digital side. That creates a lot of leverage in our business."

### Looking to the AI Future

As Bonnier navigates the AI transformation, Eriksson sees parallels to the digital transformation journey. The company's existing strategy—focusing on product development, personalization, direct customer relationships, and trusted content—positions them well for the AI era.

"We just need to do what we're doing, but just faster and better and more," Eriksson said. He emphasized the importance of protecting journalists and owning content rather than licensing it to tech platforms: "I wouldn't sell it for pretty much any price, to be honest. I think that's a dead end for us."

Looking toward 2030, Eriksson predicts newsrooms will focus even more intensely on content that delivers unique value to readers, while using AI to handle routine content more efficiently.

## Ringier's Three Pillars of Future Content

Following Eriksson's presentation, Ringier's leadership team outlined their vision for content creation, centered around three key pillars:

1. **AI-powered content**: Machine-generated content that will likely represent at least 50% of distributed material by 2030
2. **Human-powered content**: Traditional journalism where strategic resource allocation will be crucial
3. **Creator-powered content**: Highly personalized content where humans serve as individual brands

"In 2030, I can imagine that at least 50 percent of the content we distribute will be purely machine-driven, probably even more," noted a Ringier executive. "We need to balance these relations quite well."

### Ringier's AI-Powered Content Strategy

Peter Kraus, Ringier's Head of Data, detailed the company's ambitious AI initiatives across the news media value chain:

"The advent of LLMs is comparable to the invention of the printing press," Kraus said, quoting a former colleague. "It makes content creation cheaper. More content is generated for a cheaper price. This goes to the core of the business of news media, because this is at the end what we are selling. This is definitely disruptive for all of us. But if you ask me, it's also quite an opportunity."

Ringier has organized its data operations into four key teams:

1. **Ontology**: Developing common data structures at the source
2. **Agentic**: Exploring how to increase efficiency with AI agents
3. **Upscaling and Enablement**: Supporting the implementation of AI tools across markets
4. **Media Innovation**: Exploring how to create entirely new media brands leveraging AI

### Portoise: An Intelligent Content Repository

Kraus demonstrated Portoise, Ringier's shared content repository that processes 10,000 articles weekly from across the company's brands. Using Palantir Foundry technology, Portoise adds layers of intelligence to content, enabling:

- Searching for similar articles
- Identifying relevant content across markets
- Predicting article performance
- Automating content recommendation
- Supporting semi-automated content verticals
- Enabling data-to-content generation

In a live demonstration, Kraus showed how Portoise's new AI search agent can find content relevant to specific topics without requiring exact keyword matches—a capability that could significantly enhance content discovery and reuse across Ringier's properties.

"The vision is that a journalist logs into their computer in the morning, gets the recommendations of the day, especially with the time when to publish, with what probability, how much traffic that will generate," explained a Ringier executive. "And in a third step, probably automize it together with our partners to automatically feed your publications and make it even individualized on a personal level, because we believe that is the differentiation factor in the future."

The presentations from both Bonnier and Ringier highlighted how established media companies are navigating the transition from print to digital and now to AI-enhanced operations. While acknowledging the disruptive nature of these changes, both organizations emphasized the opportunities to create more personalized, valuable content experiences while improving operational efficiency. The key to success appears to be maintaining editorial independence and quality journalism while embracing technological innovation to better serve audiences and ensure financial sustainability.
