## Executive Summary

At a recent leadership summit, Ringier executives gathered to discuss the company's approach to AI integration across its media operations. Marc, Ringier's AI ambassador, delivered a compelling opening address emphasizing that the meeting was focused on execution rather than strategy. With board members Michael and Nancy in attendance, the summit brought together leaders from Ringier's 120 media brands across 15 countries to explore how AI is reshaping the media landscape and how the company plans to maintain its position as an innovation leader.

## The Three Layers of AI Transformation

Marc began his address by defining AI's impact across three distinct levels that affect Ringier's operations:

### The Workforce Layer

The first level involves the people—all employees and teams who must adapt to the new AI-driven environment. Marc emphasized that every team member must embrace AI tools to become more efficient, creative, and successful. He stated unequivocally: "If they think they should not learn how to deal with AI, they are the wrong people for you in your teams because they will slow you down."

### The Engine Room

The second level concerns data efficiency—the behind-the-scenes infrastructure that powers AI capabilities. Marc highlighted Ringier's initiative with Palantir, explaining that their AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform) collaboration would help structure data for radically more efficient use across the organization.

### The Customer-Facing Layer

The third level addresses how users interact with content in the age of AI. Marc noted that consumer expectations have fundamentally changed: "They don't want to click through complicated layers in order to find their car, their news, their ticket, their flat, their job. They want to ask the chat something and get an immediate answer."

## The Changing Digital Ecosystem

Marc pointed out that AI and large language models are completely transforming the ecosystem of the World Wide Web. The changes are already evident, with several leaders acknowledging they've lost traffic, visits, and views because of large language models and chat interfaces.

"Content creation gets commoditized," Marc warned. "Anybody can create videos, podcasts, texts, of course, et cetera" within seconds, fundamentally challenging what had previously been a unique opportunity and business model for media companies.

He specifically mentioned ChatGPT Atlas as a revolutionary step toward what OpenAI calls "the super assistant," noting that AI agents will soon become colleagues to everyone in the organization. "This is only the beginning of this new era of browsers," he stated.

## From Technology Support to Business Infrastructure

A crucial shift Marc highlighted was the evolution of technology's role in media organizations. "Technology has been kind of a supporting function," he reflected, referring to his experience as a journalist in the pre-World Wide Web era. "Well, it's not anymore. Tech today is your business infrastructure, full stop."

This perspective frames Ringier's partnership with Palantir, which Marc described as replacing "fragmented tools with a single operating system for both insights and, more important, action." He encouraged attendees to watch the recent announcement of the partnership between Palantir and NVIDIA, describing it as "groundbreaking."

## Three Media-Focused AI Initiatives

Marc outlined three specific AI initiatives being developed by Ringier's media team:

1. **Proteus**: Predictive performance models for content
2. **Automated audience segmentation**: Tools to better understand and target readers
3. **Florian**: Real-time advertising optimization

These practical applications demonstrate how AI is being integrated into core media operations. As Marc put it, "AI is not replacing journalists. AI is replacing the 'I think we should do it this way because I feel it and we have always done it this way' culture."

## The Challenge of Execution

While innovation was the primary challenge during the first era of digital transformation, Marc emphasized that the current challenge is integration and execution. "Most industries run on the same technology," he noted. "They all have a level ground of basically the starting point."

What will differentiate successful media organizations is not access to technology but how effectively they integrate and execute their AI strategies. This requires a cultural shift within newsrooms and supporting teams.

## Leaders as Translators

Marc called on the leaders present to become "translators"—individuals who can bridge the gap between business needs and AI capabilities. "Every leader must become a translator," he insisted. "Translator is those who translate between business and AI."

The key to success, according to Marc, is attitude and openness. Leaders must foster a culture that embraces technology and demonstrates flexibility and resilience through the inevitable challenges of the learning curve.

## Ringier's Transformation Journey

Reflecting on Ringier's evolution, Marc expressed pride in how the company has transformed over the past 15-17 years "from being a publisher with printing plans to becoming one of the leaders as a media tech company here in Europe."

He also acknowledged the quality of journalism now being delivered across all of Ringier's brands, noting that "all the brands in here deliver really good journalism," something that "has not always been the case."

## The Newsroom of the Future

Marc concluded with a powerful statement about the immediacy of change: "The newsroom of the future is not a plan for 2030. It's what you are building today."

This sentiment underscored the summit's focus on execution rather than distant strategy, encouraging leaders to take advantage of the collaborative opportunities provided by the meeting and dinner to advance their understanding and implementation of AI technologies.

As Ringier continues its transformation journey, the company remains committed to maintaining its position as an innovation leader while delivering quality journalism across its diverse portfolio of media brands.
