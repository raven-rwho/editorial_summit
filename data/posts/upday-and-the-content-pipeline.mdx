## Summary
In a revealing presentation at Ringier's headquarters in Zurich, Benedict, a leader at Upday, shared how the former Axel Springer-Samsung joint venture was transformed from a winding-down operation into an innovative AI-powered news platform. What began as an experimental playground has evolved into a profitable model that could reshape how news organizations approach commodity news production.

## The Birth of an AI-First News Platform

When Axel Springer and Samsung decided to part ways after nearly a decade of partnership on Upday, the joint venture was being wound down. However, something interesting caught management's attention: despite the impending closure, Upday still had more than a million installed users.

"We realized there were two fantastic prerequisites why we should choose Upday as our AI greenfield battle," Benedict explained. First, Axel Springer's owner Matthias Döpfner suggested using Upday as an experimental playground where they could "try out everything" without consequences. Second, Upday had never positioned itself as a destination for in-depth analysis or investigative journalism.

"Upday has always been a news proposition for people who want to check: did I get everything I need to know for today? Fantastic. Ideally, even being informed by push notifications," Benedict said. This made it the perfect candidate for AI-powered transformation.

## The AI Content Pipeline: A New Business Infrastructure

At the heart of Upday's transformation is what Benedict calls their "AI content pipeline" – a sophisticated system that processes news from discovery to publication with minimal human intervention.

The pipeline begins with content discovery, drawing from news agencies, Axel Springer publications, and trending topics across the web. This content then goes through an enrichment process where multiple sources are used to verify information. Next comes fact extraction, where the AI pulls out key information without copying full articles.

"We extract facts. So imagine yourself writing a Wikipedia article out of a newspaper article," Benedict explained. "We would never copy a full article. We would always ask: what are the key actors? What is the contextual information? And what is actually the most unique new information for the reader?"

This process continues through text generation – a complex 24-step process involving different systems and LLMs – followed by image selection, a six-step verification and fact-checking process, and finally human review before publication.

## Learning Through Experimentation

The team quickly discovered unforeseen challenges when they first launched their AI system. One major issue was the AI's tendency to continuously update stories without human editorial judgment.

"The AI in the background was constantly updating and updating and updating articles," Benedict shared. "After five, six, seven days, we still had nine or ten Word pages with the prime minister from Ecuador and Paraguay and some eastern countries making statements about this meeting... completely nonsense."

This led to the development of three crucial control features:

1. **Deduplication service**: After six hours, the AI stops updating existing articles and must decide whether a new story is warranted.

2. **Content balancing**: Instead of publishing 1,500 articles daily, the AI now publishes 30-50 stories per country per day, being more selective on weekdays and less restrictive on weekends.

3. **Push notification management**: The system ensures 10-15 push notifications are sent daily, even on weekends, to maintain user engagement.

These adjustments reduced LLM costs by up to 65% and helped maintain traffic levels.

## The Human-AI Partnership

Despite the sophisticated automation, human oversight remains essential. When editors reviewed AI-generated content between July and September, they found:

- 60% required no changes
- 29% needed minor adjustments
- 11% required significant intervention

"We will never, ever be in a situation where we get this down to 0%," Benedict acknowledged. "We will always need editors at some point to check when the AI is uncertain."

To address this, the team built a task management system that flags articles where the AI expresses uncertainty, allowing journalists to provide guidance only when necessary.

## The Business Case

With approximately 700,000 monthly active users and 200,000 daily active users, Upday has achieved profitability despite the costs associated with AI content generation.

"When we produce an article, we are probably spending three to four euros per article in LLM production costs," Benedict revealed. "Whenever you need to acquire a Getty image, these three to four euros go up to 11 to 12 euros."

The platform now runs with just six part-time staff and three working students who help address AI uncertainties.

## Transparency and Future Applications

When asked about transparency, Benedict emphasized their commitment to disclosure: "Before we launched on July 1st, we sent out a push notification to everyone saying we are now an AI-first product." Each article also carries a disclaimer stating it was created with artificial intelligence.

Looking ahead, Benedict sees the potential to extend this model to other Axel Springer brands like Bild and Welt, particularly for commodity news.

"It makes absolute sense to free up resources for the fast and commodity stream," he said. "I would force the newsrooms to look through it and ask: is it really worse than what you would have been writing?"

## Conclusion

Upday's transformation demonstrates how AI can revitalize a declining media product while creating new efficiencies. By focusing on the right use case – commodity news that doesn't require deep analysis or original reporting – they've created a model that could be replicated across other news organizations.

As Benedict concluded, "For this fast commodity news stack, where not the beauty of journalism is, I guess... we have built a solution where we can just free up time for journalists to do actual journalistic work."

The experiment that began as a last-gasp effort for a dying joint venture has evolved into a potential blueprint for how news organizations might harness AI to handle routine reporting while allowing human journalists to focus on more valuable, creative work.
